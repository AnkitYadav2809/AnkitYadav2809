# Skin Disease Recognition via ResNet50 and VGG-16

## Overview

This repository contains a Kaggle notebook for skin disease recognition using the ResNet50 and VGG-16 architectures. The notebook is designed to work with the DermNet dataset, a comprehensive collection of dermatology images. The goal is to leverage deep learning models to accurately classify skin diseases from images.

## Dataset

The DermNet dataset is utilized for training and testing the models. Ensure that you have the dataset downloaded and organized properly before running the notebook. You can find the DermNet dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skin-disease-recognition.git
cd skin-disease-recognition
```

2. Download and organize the DermNet dataset.

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Skin_Disease_Recognition.ipynb
```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the models.

## Models

The notebook includes implementations for two popular deep learning architectures:

1. **ResNet50:** A deep residual network with 50 layers that has shown excellent performance in image recognition tasks.

2. **VGG-16:** A convolutional neural network with 16 layers known for its simplicity and effectiveness.

## Usage

Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the images, train the models, and evaluate their performance. You can experiment with hyperparameters and fine-tune the models for better results.

## Results

The notebook provides insights into the models' performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Analyze the results to understand how well the models are classifying different skin diseases.
